## 2. _due 10/25_ Project topic
Choose 3+ parallel sorting algorithms, implement in MPI and CUDA.  Examine and compare performance in detail (computation time, communication time, how much data is sent) on a variety of inputs: sorted, random, reverse, sorted with 1% perturbed, etc.  Strong scaling, weak scaling, GPU performance.

## 2. _due 10/25_ Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)
- Enumeration Sort (MPI + CUDA)
- Enumeration Sort (MPI on each core)
- Odd-Even Transposition Sort (MPI + CUDA)
- Odd-Even Transposition Sort (MPI on each core)
- Parallel Merge Sort (MPI + CUDA)
- Parallel Merge Sort (MPI on each core)
